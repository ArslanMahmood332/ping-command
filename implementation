Step 1: Open Powershell on start menu.
        Choose your favorite way to open a powershell prompt. On Windows 10, I prefer to click the Windows Key, type 'power' and click enter.
        
Step 2: Start-Transcript to record your Powershell Session

        #PS> Start-Transcript -path C:/Script/PingLog.txt -Append
        
        This command is one for your arsenal. Record everything that occurs in your powershell prompt, Never lose any of that work ever again!
        I think this is pretty self explanatory, The Append flag is telling it to continue on if the file already exists, this isn't necessary,
        and depends on how you would like to name/use the file. If you don't use this however, if the file exists already, it wipes it and starts over.
        That's why I include it here.
        
Step 3: Ping.exe ... With a twist!

        So here is the meat of our little guide. Lets timestamp that ping.

        #PS> Ping.exe -t spiceworks.com | ForEach {"{0} - {1}" -f (Get-Date),$_}
        
        Lets break this down real quick.

        Ping.exe - That's ping! powershell can use your CMD stuff just fine.
        -t is as we all know, a continuous ping. can go before or after our hostname/IP address.

        spiceworks.com is what we're pinging.

        Next up is a pipe (|) - We're sending our information over to our next command.

        Foreach is the next thing in our command here.

        [{0} - {1} -f] - This is the text formatting.

        (Get-Date) - This is the date! it's also what's going into {0} in the text formatting above.

        $_ - This is you taking your previous input from ping and putting into {1}
